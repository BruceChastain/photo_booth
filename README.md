# photo_booth
this software is in support of a photo booth I'm creating. The overall idea is that the user can press a big button on the 
front of the photo booth, they will then have 10 seconds before the camera takes the photo. The photos will be saved on 
an external hard drive connected to the raspberry pi which is used to drive the camera.This doesn't work well on the original raspberry pi, but does work good with the 3B.
